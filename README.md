Godot-3D-Procedural-Infinite-Terrain

Made in Godot 4.4, Scene looks empty until you press play, then it should load the procedural infinite terrain

Use WASD to move around, space bar to fly up, and shift key to sprint, press T key to change time ahead 1 hour

Please try to change parameters of terrain and make large valleys, high mountains, deep oceans, increase vertices of chunks to make more detail and less blocky, try to change textures, try to see what you can make with this
